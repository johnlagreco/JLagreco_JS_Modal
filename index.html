<!-- A modal is similar to a lightbox in that it obscures existing content on the page to alert the user to an important fact or bit of text.

Create a webpage with a modal that opens when a user clicks on a link or button on the page. The modal should be centered vertically and horizontally and show text that the user didn't previously see on the page. When the user clicks on the modal or around it, it should disappear.

Use git and make appropriate commits.
Push to GitHub and submit your link. -->
